# Week Thirteen Challenge: eCommerce Database

## Description

This repository is where I refactor code to create an app for managing an eCommerce database.

## Usage

Run node.js to initiate the eCommerce back end application. You can view and edit the database by using the relevant api route and paramaters in Insomnia.
